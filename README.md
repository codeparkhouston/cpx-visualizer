# CPX data visualizer

Takes CPX [logged data](https://github.com/codeparkhouston/cpx-project-protoype/tree/master/cpx-data-logging/accelerometer-temperature-light) from accelerometer, temperature sensor and light sensor and visualizes the pitch and roll as rotation and temperature as color on a 3D model of a CPX.
